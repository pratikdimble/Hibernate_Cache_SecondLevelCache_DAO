# Hibernate_Cache_SecondLevelCache_DAO
Hibernate second level cache uses a common cache for all the session object of a session factory. It is useful if you have multiple session objects from a session factory.  SessionFactory holds the second level cache data. It is global for all the session objects and not enabled by default. Each implementation provides different cache usage functionality. There are four ways to use second level cache.  read-only: caching will work for read only operation. nonstrict-read-write: caching will work for read and write but one at a time. read-write: caching will work for read and write, can be used simultaneously. transactional: caching will work for transaction.
